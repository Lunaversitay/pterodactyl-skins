# Pterodactyl Skins

Got bored, made skins, I don't support them really but they should pretty much work on any version behind 0.8

# Installing (Client)

You can use the tamper monkey script included with the files on any pterodactyl site using the default theme
All you need to do is change the @match tag to the URL you're using (ex: `https://dino.gg/*` )

# Installing (Server)

If you want to install this on your machine all you have to do is add the css file to your public folder, then make the master blade & admin blade see it via `<link href="#" rel="stylesheet">`. It's that simple.
